# PgBouncer userlist.txt
# Format: "username" "password"
# 
# This file is auto-generated or manually created with your DB credentials.
# For security, passwords can be MD5 hashed: "user" "md5<hash>"
#
# In production, replace with your actual credentials or use environment variables
# with a script that generates this file at container startup.
#
# Example (plain text - for development only):
# "postgres" "your_password_here"
#
# Example (MD5 - recommended for production):
# "postgres" "md5<md5(password + username)>"
#
# Note: The password here should match POSTGRES_PASSWORD in your .env.production
# Generate MD5: echo -n "passwordusername" | md5sum
